# Adiu.AI

***The term 'adiu' - a homonym to 'audio' - is derived from the Latin word 'adiutor' which means 'assistant'.***

***Adiu.AI is a multinational social-impact startup that develops AI-powered tools to help speech therapists streamline and accelerate the detection of speech impairments. As the CTO of the startup, I was responsible for researching and validating innovative yet practical AI technologies to shape product development.***

Here are my co-founders!

**Initial Pretotyping Hypothesis:** A product that automatically detects stuttering would be highly valued by speech therapists, as it would significantly reduce the need for manual analysis.

**Validating the Technical Feasibility of an Early-Stage Product:** (code can be accessed [here](https://github.com/adharshasam/Adiu.AI/blob/main/Lean_Technical_Feasibility_Testing_%26_Validation_with_ML_Model_MVP.ipynb))

These insights demonstrate that the stuttering detection app is technically feasible and can guide the development of a fully-fledged prototype. This AI product, which determines whether a patient has a stuttering issue based on audio data, can be built using the following ML techniques.

**To test the Market Viability of this Product, we pitched this "Feasible Product Idea" as our MVP 1.0 to Early Adopters (Speech Therapists based in both Singapore & Australia). This idea of "Pitching without Product" was inspired by Jim Poss (Inventor of the BigBelly Solar Trash Compactor).** 

We learnt that this product could only be sold to doctors at Fluency Clinics which further reduces the sample size of our already small pool of target users. This means that we might not be able to build a profitable business in the long run. So, we chose to quickly **PIVOT** to a New Product Idea!

**Starting from Scratch...**

After gaining a better understanding of the pain points of our Early Adopters, we decided to create a **Speech Transcription Software** that assists speech therapists in annotating and transcribing patient audio files without autocorrecting mistakes, thereby reducing the overall time spent on monotonous manual tasks!

**To gain more Target User Feedback on this new idea, we designed a Product Survey with our MVP 2.0 (Product Demo Video) and a set of well-curated follow-up questions to gain insightful feedback. This idea of creating a "Product Demo Video" to gauge interest was inspired by Drew Houston's (CEO of Dropbox) Product Demo Video which he uploaded on Hacker News for Product Validation.**

Here are some promising survey results!

**THE. FINAL. PITCH.** ü¶à

We gave our Final Pitch to a panel of Angel Investors after 4 months of hardwork and Adiu bagged the "Best Startup Award" among 11 total startups in the cohort! ü§ç
